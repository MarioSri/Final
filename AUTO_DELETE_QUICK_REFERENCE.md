# Auto-Delete Feature - Quick Reference

## Summary
Implemented automatic deletion of messages and channels in the Department Chat section of the Messages page.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Message Auto-Deletion
- **Timeline**: Messages automatically deleted after **24 hours**
- **Frequency**: Cleanup runs every **1 hour**
- **Notification**: Users see toast notification when cleanup occurs
- **Visual Indicator**: Badge showing "Auto-delete: 24h" in channel header

### 2. Channel Auto-Deletion
- **Timeline**: Channels automatically deleted after **7 days (1 week)**
- **Frequency**: Cleanup runs every **24 hours**
- **Notification**: Users see toast notification when cleanup occurs
- **Visual Indicator**: Warning box in channel sidebar showing "Auto-delete: Channels after 7 days"
- **Smart Handling**: Automatically switches to another channel if active channel is deleted

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`**
   - Added `cleanupMessages()` function
   - Added `cleanupChannels()` function
   - Added useEffect hooks for automatic cleanup intervals
   - Added UI badges and indicators
   - Added Clock icon import

## UI Changes

### Channel Header
- Added yellow badge with clock icon showing "Auto-delete: 24h"
- Located next to member count

### Channel Sidebar
- Added yellow warning box showing "Auto-delete: Channels after 7 days"
- Located below the channel header
- Uses AlertTriangle icon

## How It Works

### Message Cleanup
```typescript
// Runs every hour
setInterval(cleanupMessages, 60 * 60 * 1000);

// Filters out messages older than 24 hours
const twentyFourHoursAgo = new Date(now.getTime() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
messages.filter(message => new Date(message.timestamp) > twentyFourHoursAgo);
```

### Channel Cleanup
```typescript
// Runs every 24 hours
setInterval(cleanupChannels, 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);

// Filters out channels older than 7 days
const oneWeekAgo = new Date(now.getTime() - 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
channels.filter(channel => new Date(channel.createdAt) > oneWeekAgo);
```

## User Experience

### Automatic Notifications
- When messages are deleted: **"Messages Cleaned - X old message(s) automatically deleted"**
- When channels are deleted: **"Channels Cleaned - X old channel(s) automatically deleted"**

### Console Logging
- All cleanup operations are logged to console for debugging
- Format: `"Auto-deleted X message(s) older than 24 hours"`
- Format: `"Auto-deleted X channel(s) older than 1 week"`

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Navigate to Messages page → Department Chat tab
2. Look for the yellow "Auto-delete: 24h" badge in channel header
3. Look for the warning box in the channel sidebar
4. Create test messages and channels
5. Wait for cleanup intervals or temporarily modify the time thresholds for testing

## Configuration

To modify settings, edit `ChatInterface.tsx`:

**Change message retention (24 hours → X hours):**
```typescript
const twentyFourHoursAgo = new Date(now.getTime() - X * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

**Change channel retention (7 days → X days):**
```typescript
const oneWeekAgo = new Date(now.getTime() - X * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

**Change message cleanup frequency (1 hour → X hours):**
```typescript
setInterval(cleanupMessages, X * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

**Change channel cleanup frequency (24 hours → X hours):**
```typescript
setInterval(cleanupChannels, X * 60 * 60 * 1000);
```
