# HITAM Tree Animation Fix

## Issue Description
The animated HITAM tree logo was sometimes missing after multiple logins due to CSS animation caching and component reuse.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **CSS Animation Caching**: CSS animations only run once when an element is first mounted
2. **Component Reuse**: React may reuse the same component instance across multiple renders
3. **Missing Animation Reset**: No mechanism to restart animations on subsequent loads
4. **Image Loading Issues**: No fallback when tree logo image fails to load

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Animation Key Management
- Added `animationKey` state that generates unique keys using `Date.now()`
- Each animated element now uses unique keys to force re-mounting
- Animations restart properly on every component mount

### 2. Image Loading Enhancement
- Added proper image load/error handling
- Implemented CSS fallback tree design for when image fails to load
- Added loading state management for images

### 3. Loading State Improvements
- Enhanced AuthContext with proper try/catch/finally blocks
- Increased minimum loading time to 2.5 seconds for better animation visibility
- Added loading key management in Index page
- Proper cleanup on logout with session storage clearing

### 4. CSS Fallback Tree
Added pure CSS tree design as fallback:
```css
.hitam-tree-fallback {
  /* Creates a tree shape using CSS clip-path */
  /* Includes trunk and canopy with gradients */
  /* Maintains same animation classes */
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/ui/loading-animation.tsx` - Core animation fixes
2. `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Loading key management
3. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced loading state management
4. `src/index.css` - Added CSS fallback tree design

## Key Features
- ✅ Animations always restart on every login
- ✅ Unique keys prevent animation caching
- ✅ CSS fallback for image loading failures
- ✅ Proper error handling and state management
- ✅ Enhanced user experience with consistent loading
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality

## Testing Recommendations
1. Login multiple times in succession to verify animations restart
2. Test with network disabled to verify CSS fallback
3. Clear browser cache between tests
4. Test on different devices and browsers

## Future Enhancements
- Consider preloading tree logo image
- Add animation preferences for accessibility
- Implement progressive loading for slower connections
