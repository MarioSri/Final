# üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## The PDF Viewer Setup is Complete - Now Test It!

### ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed:
1. Worker file is in place (`public/pdf.worker.min.mjs` - 1 MB)
2. PDF.js is installed (v5.4.296)
3. FileViewer has extensive logging added
4. Error handling improved

---

## üéØ NEXT STEPS - Do This Now:

### Step 1: Restart Dev Server (IMPORTANT!)
The dev server needs to be restarted to serve the new worker file.

```powershell
# In the terminal running the dev server:
1. Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
2. Wait for it to fully stop
3. Run: npm run dev
4. Wait for "Local: http://localhost:5173" message
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
```
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Close browser completely
5. Reopen browser
```

### Step 3: Test the Worker File
**Open this URL first:**
```
http://localhost:5173/test-worker.html
```

**You should see:**
- ‚úÖ Green message: "Worker file is accessible!"

**If you see ‚ùå red message:**
- Server not restarted properly
- Try Step 1 again

### Step 4: Test PDF Viewing

1. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/documents`
2. Upload a **small, simple PDF** (< 5 MB)
3. Click "View" button
4. **Open DevTools immediately** (Press F12)
5. Go to **Console** tab

**Look for logs like:**
```
PDF.js version: 5.4.296
Setting worker source to: /pdf.worker.min.mjs
Starting PDF load for file: [your-file.pdf]
ArrayBuffer created, size: [number]
Creating PDF loading task...
Waiting for PDF to load...
PDF loaded successfully! Pages: [number]
```

## üìä What to Share If Still Not Working:

### 1. Worker Test Result
Visit `http://localhost:5173/test-worker.html` and share:
- What color message do you see? (Green ‚úÖ or Red ‚ùå)
- Screenshot if possible

### 2. Browser Console Output
When you click "View" on a PDF:
- Press F12
- Go to Console tab
- Copy ALL the logs (especially any errors in red)
- Share them with me

### 3. Network Tab
- F12 ‚Üí Network tab
- Click "View" on PDF
- Look for `/pdf.worker.min.mjs` request
- What's the status? (200, 404, etc.)
- Screenshot if possible

## üîç Common Issues:

### Issue: Worker test shows red ‚ùå
**Cause:** Server not restarted or worker file not served

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# Verify file exists:
Test-Path "public\pdf.worker.min.mjs"  # Should return True

# Restart server:
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Console shows "404 Not Found" for worker
**Cause:** Server not serving public folder correctly

**Fix:** Make sure you restarted the dev server after adding the worker file

### Issue: Console shows "Setting up fake worker failed"
**Cause:** Worker file exists but can't be loaded

**Fix:** Try the CDN approach - edit `FileViewer.tsx` line ~9:
```tsx
// Change to:
pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = 
  `https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@${pdfjsLib.version}/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs`;
```

## ‚ö° Quick Test Command

Run this to verify everything:

```powershell
# Check worker file
Test-Path "public\pdf.worker.min.mjs"

# Check if server is running
Get-Process -Name node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select-Object Id

# If no processes shown, start server:
npm run dev
```

---

## üéØ Expected Behavior When Working:

1. **Worker test page:** Green ‚úÖ message
2. **Console logs:** See all the "Starting PDF load..." messages
3. **PDF modal:** Shows the PDF rendered on canvas
4. **No errors:** Console should be clean (no red errors)
5. **Controls work:** Zoom in/out, rotate, download all work

---

## üìû I'm Here to Help!

**Please run Step 1-4 above and share:**
1. Result from worker test page (green or red?)
2. Console output when viewing PDF (copy/paste or screenshot)
3. Any error messages you see

With this information, I can tell you exactly what's wrong! üîç

## üí° Alternative: Test with CDN Right Now

If you want to test immediately without debugging, edit `FileViewer.tsx`:

Find line ~9 that says:
```tsx
pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = '/pdf.worker.min.mjs';
```

Change to:
```tsx
pdfjsLib.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = 
  `https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@5.4.296/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs`;
```

Save, refresh browser, and try viewing a PDF. This uses CDN instead of local file.
