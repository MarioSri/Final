# ✅ FileViewer Integration - Corrected Implementation

## 🎯 **What Changed**

Based on your feedback, I've corrected the implementation:

### **❌ Removed: "Documents Under Review" Section**
- You already have "Upload Documents" in the "Create New Workflow" section
- The duplicate section has been removed from `ApprovalRouting.tsx`

### **✅ Added: FileViewer to WorkflowConfiguration**
- FileViewer integrated into the existing "Upload Documents" option
- This appears when **BYPASS MODE** is active in Approval Chain page

---

## 📦 **Final Implementation**

### **1. Emergency Management Page** ✅

**File:** `src/components/EmergencyWorkflowInterface.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Import FileViewer
- ✅ State variables (viewingFile, showFileViewer)
- ✅ Modified handleViewFile to use modal
- ✅ Added FileViewer component

**Result:** Files open in modal when "View" clicked

---

### **2. Approval Chain with Bypass Page** ✅

**Files Modified:**
1. `src/pages/ApprovalRouting.tsx`
   - ✅ Import FileViewer
   - ✅ State variables (viewingFile, showFileViewer)
   - ✅ handleViewFile function
   - ✅ FileViewer component at end
   - ✅ NO duplicate upload section (removed)

2. `src/components/WorkflowConfiguration.tsx`
   - ✅ Import FileViewer
   - ✅ State variables (viewingFile, showFileViewer)
   - ✅ Modified handleViewFile to use modal
   - ✅ Added FileViewer component
   - ✅ Existing "Upload Documents" now has FileViewer

**Result:** When Bypass Mode active → Upload Documents section → Click "View" → Modal opens

## 🔍 **Key Differences from Before**

### **Before (Incorrect):**
```
Approval Chain Page
├── Statistics cards
├── Features overview
├── Bypass Configuration
└── Documents Under Review ❌ (duplicate section we added)
    └── Upload area
    └── File list
```

### **After (Correct):**
```
Approval Chain Page
├── Statistics cards
├── Features overview
└── Bypass Configuration (when active)
    └── WorkflowConfiguration component
        └── Create New Workflow section
            └── Upload Documents (already existed)
                └── NOW has FileViewer integration ✅
```
