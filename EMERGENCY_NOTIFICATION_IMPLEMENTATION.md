# Emergency Notification Logic Implementation

## üîî Updated Notification Logic for Emergency Management

### Implementation Summary

The Emergency Management system now includes comprehensive notification logic with the following key features:

#### 1. **Notification Behavior Options**

**‚úÖ Receive Notifications Based on Selected Recipients' Profile Settings**
- Each recipient receives notifications according to their profile preferences
- Supports Email, SMS, Push, and WhatsApp channels
- Individual interval settings per channel (minutes, hours, days)
- Stored in localStorage as `user-preferences-{userId}`

**‚úÖ Override for Emergency (Takes Priority)**
- Bypasses profile settings when activated
- Manual configuration of emergency-specific channels
- Custom scheduling intervals
- Two strategies: Recipient-Based and Document-Based

#### 2. **‚è±Ô∏è Scheduling Options**

**‚úÖ Predefined Intervals:**
- Every 1 minute
- Every 15 minutes  
- Hourly
- Daily
- Weekly
- Custom intervals (X days/hours)

**‚úÖ Time Units Supported:**
- Seconds, Minutes, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months

#### 3. **‚öôÔ∏è Behavior Implementation**

**Default Flow:**
```typescript
if (useProfileDefaults) {
  // Fetch each recipient's profile notification preferences
  // Apply individual preferences for each notification channel
  // Send notifications according to each recipient's settings
}
```

**Override Flow:**
```typescript
if (overrideForEmergency) {
  // Bypass all profile settings
  // Apply emergency-specific notification configuration
  // Use recipient-based or document-based strategy
  // Send notifications immediately through selected channels
}
```

**Priority Logic:**
```
Emergency Override > Profile Defaults > System Defaults
```

### üéØ Usage Example

```typescript
// Emergency submission with notification logic
const emergencyDocument = {
  id: "emergency-123",
  title: "Infrastructure Emergency",
  description: "Critical system failure",
  urgencyLevel: "critical",
  submittedBy: "Admin"
};

const notificationSettings = {
  useProfileDefaults: false,
  overrideForEmergency: true,
  notificationStrategy: "recipient-based",
  channels: [
    { type: "email", enabled: true, interval: 15, unit: "minutes" },
    { type: "sms", enabled: true, interval: 30, unit: "minutes" },
    { type: "push", enabled: true, interval: 5, unit: "minutes" }
  ]
};

await emergencyNotificationService.sendEmergencyNotification(
  recipients,
  emergencyDocument,
  notificationSettings
);
```

### üîç Cross-Check: What's Done vs Requirements

**‚úÖ COMPLETED:**
- ‚úÖ Profile-based notification preferences
- ‚úÖ Emergency override functionality  
- ‚úÖ Recipient-based and document-based strategies
- ‚úÖ Scheduling intervals (1 min, 15 min, hourly, daily, weekly, custom)
- ‚úÖ Multi-channel support (Email, SMS, Push, WhatsApp)
- ‚úÖ Priority-based notification logic
- ‚úÖ Real-time behavior preview
- ‚úÖ Notification logging and tracking
- ‚úÖ Integration with existing emergency workflow

**‚úÖ BEHAVIOR SUMMARY:**
- ‚úÖ Default: Recipients' profile notification settings
- ‚úÖ Override: Emergency-specific settings take priority
- ‚úÖ Immediate delivery for critical emergencies
- ‚úÖ Proper escalation and scheduling

### üéâ Result

The Emergency Management system now has a complete, sophisticated notification logic that:

1. **Respects user preferences** by default
2. **Allows emergency overrides** when needed
3. **Supports flexible scheduling** with multiple intervals
4. **Provides real-time feedback** on notification behavior
5. **Ensures critical alerts** reach recipients immediately
6. **Maintains comprehensive logging** for audit and analytics

The implementation follows the exact specifications provided and integrates seamlessly with the existing emergency workflow interface.
