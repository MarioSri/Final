## üéØ Where Blockchain Can Be Used

### 1. **Digital Signatures** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Current Location**: `src/hooks/useDocumensoAPI.ts`, `src/components/DocumensoIntegration.tsx`

**What It Does**:
- Records signature hashes on Polygon blockchain
- Creates immutable proof of who signed and when
- Enables anyone to verify signature authenticity

**Why It Matters**:
- Prevents signature forgery
- Legal proof of signing
- No central authority needed for verification

**Cost**: $0.00004 per signature

---

### 2. **Document Audit Trails** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Current Location**: `src/contexts/DocumentWorkflowContext.tsx`, `src/services/DocumentWorkflowIntegration.ts`

**What It Does**:
- Records every workflow step on blockchain
- Tracks: submission ‚Üí HOD review ‚Üí registrar ‚Üí principal approval
- Creates tamper-proof history

**Why It Matters**:
- Prevents backdating of approvals
- Complete transparency of approval process
- Institutional accountability

**Cost**: $0.00003 per event

---

### 3. **Certificate Issuance** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Current Location**: `src/hooks/useDocumensoAPI.ts`

**What It Does**:
- Issues certificates as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)
- Stores certificate data on IPFS
- Creates verifiable, portable credentials

**Why It Matters**:
- Students can prove credentials anywhere
- Employers can verify instantly
- Certificates cannot be faked

**Cost**: $0.00006 per certificate

---

### 4. **Watermark Authentication** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current Location**: `src/components/WatermarkFeature.tsx`

**What It Does**:
- Stores watermark hash on blockchain
- Enables instant document verification
- Creates public verification portal

**Why It Matters**:
- Instant authenticity checking
- Prevents document tampering
- Public trust in documents

**Cost**: $0.00004 per watermark

---

### 5. **Smart Contract Workflows** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current Location**: `src/contexts/DocumentWorkflowContext.tsx`

**What It Does**:
- Automates approval workflows
- Enforces institutional rules
- Automatic progression based on signatures

**Why It Matters**:
- No manual intervention needed
- Rules cannot be changed mid-process
- Transparent execution

**Cost**: $0.00005 per workflow step

---

### 6. **Identity Management** ‚≠ê‚≠ê (LOW PRIORITY)
**Current Location**: `src/components/AuthenticationCard.tsx`

**What It Does**:
- Self-sovereign identity for users
- Decentralized credentials
- Portable institutional identity

**Why It Matters**:
- Users own their identity
- Works across institutions
- Enhanced privacy

**Cost**: $0.00008 per identity
